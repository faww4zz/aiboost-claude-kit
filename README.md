# AI Boost Center — Claude Code Starter Kit

A starter kit for new Claude Code users. Built for AI Boost Center training participants, but free for anyone.

**One install bundles six skills** — they work straight away, no extra setup, no `npm`, no internet downloads after install:

- **`/prompt-master`** — turns a rough idea into one clean, ready-to-paste prompt for any AI tool.
- **`/humanizer`** — strips the AI tells out of any text so it reads like you wrote it.
- **`/researcher`** — deep, multi-source research with real sources.
- **`/caveman`** — same answer, far fewer words. Fun, and saves tokens.
- **`/find-skills`** — finds and installs more skills, just describe what you want.
- **`/frontend-slides`** — builds slide decks, dashboards, and small web pages.

Plus two commands:

- **`/welcome`** — a plain-language orientation for your first hour on Claude Code.
- **`/setup-kit`** — installs the one extra tool (superpowers) that ships separately.

## How to install

In Claude Code (desktop app, or the terminal), run these two lines:

```
/plugin marketplace add faww4zz/aiboost-claude-kit
/plugin install aiboost-starter
```

That's it. If a permission box pops up, click **Allow**. No admin rights needed — it installs to your own user folder.

Then type `/welcome` to get started, and `/setup-kit` to add superpowers.

## Prefer one plain-English prompt? Paste this into Claude Code

If the slash commands feel fiddly, just paste this message to Claude and it will do it for you:

> Add the marketplace `faww4zz/aiboost-claude-kit` and install the `aiboost-starter` plugin from it. Then add the marketplace `anthropics/claude-plugins-official` and install the `superpowers` plugin. After each step, tell me whether it worked. If a permission prompt appears, tell me what to click.

## If the plugin install is blocked on your machine

Some work computers block plugin installs. If `/plugin install` does not work, use the **drop-in folder** instead — you copy the skills straight into Claude Code by hand. No install command, no admin rights.

See the [`dropin/`](dropin/) folder and follow [`dropin/INSTALL.md`](dropin/INSTALL.md). In short: copy the `skills` and `commands` folders into your `~/.claude/` folder, restart Claude Code, done.

## What's inside

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/welcome` | Orients a brand-new user. What Claude Code is, what to try first. |
| `/setup-kit` | Installs superpowers (the one tool not bundled). |
| `/prompt-master` | A prompt engineer in a skill. Rough idea in, clean prompt out. |
| `/humanizer` | Makes writing sound like a person, not an AI. |
| `/researcher` | Deep research with real sources. |
| `/caveman` | Same answer, fewer words. |
| `/find-skills` | Finds and installs more skills. |
| `/frontend-slides` | Builds slides, dashboards, and web pages. |

The bundled skills are the work of their original authors, included here to make setup painless for training participants. **superpowers** is by Anthropic and installs from its own marketplace.
